# Repo setup

To use the code in this repo, your system must be set up for RP2040 C/C++ development. 

### VS Code extensions

The 

- CMake: `twxs.cmake`
- CMake Tools: `ms-vscode.cmake-tools`
- C/C++: `ms-vscode.cpptools`
- Cortex-Debug: `marus25.cortex-debug`
- Python: `ms-python.python`
- Bazel: `BazelBuild.vscode-bazel`


## Hardware
This project makes use of the very handy [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html) although this is only one of several ways of uploading code to and debugging the Pico microcontroller found on the StepUp! circuit board.

### Debugging on MacOS
To get openocd to play ball, you must install the following libraries as described in the `openocd/README.macOS` file:
```
brew install libtool automake libusb libusb-compat hidapi libftdi
```

### Debugging in Linux

#### 1. Enable `arm-none-eabi-gdb`
To debug in Linux, you need to ensure you have `arm-none-eabi-gdb` installed. If you can build firmware for the Pico, odds are this is already installed on your PC but not symlinked correctly. To link this, run the following with elevated priveleges (`sudo`)
```shell
ln -s /usr/bin/gdb-multiarch /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb
```
You should now see that running `arm-none-eabi-gdb` works as expected.

#### 2. Configure Linux to recognise device
By following the very useful steps outlined [here](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=364698), you can configure your udev rules to recognise the Pico plugged in as a CMSIS-DAP interface.

The relevant steps in the linked guide are as follows:
1. Create a file `10-my-usb.rules` in `/etc/udev/rules.d` containing
```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000c", MODE="666", GROUP="plugdev"
```
2. Now, restart the udev service using
```shell
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger
```

## IDEs

Workspace files are included for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Credits

This work leans heavily on Tony Smith's (a.k.a [smittytone](https://github.com/smittytone)) wonderful [RP2040-FreeRTOS Template](https://github.com/smittytone/RP2040-FreeRTOS) which forms the basic structure for most of this project. Kudos to his work on creating a simple platform to get started with FreeRTOS on the Pi Pico hardware.
